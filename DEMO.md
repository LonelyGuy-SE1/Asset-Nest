# Demo Video Guide for Asset Nest

This guide helps you record a compelling demo video for the hackathon submission.

## üìπ Video Requirements

- **Duration:** 3-5 minutes
- **Format:** MP4, 1080p recommended
- **Content:** Must show working MetaMask Smart Accounts integration on Monad

## üé¨ Demo Script

### Introduction (30 seconds)

"Hi! I'm presenting Asset Nest, an AI-powered smart portfolio rebalancer built on Monad using MetaMask Smart Accounts."

**Show:** Landing page with project title and description

### Problem Statement (30 seconds)

"Managing crypto portfolios is challenging. Users need to constantly monitor prices, compute optimal trades, and pay high gas fees. Asset Nest solves this with autonomous AI-powered rebalancing."

**Show:** Current portfolio with imbalanced allocations

### Solution Overview (1 minute)

"Asset Nest uses four key technologies:

1. **MetaMask Smart Accounts** - For gasless, automated trading
2. **Monad L1** - High-performance blockchain with 10,000 TPS
3. **Monorail** - Optimal swap routing and best prices
4. **AI Agent** - Intelligent rebalancing strategies using OpenAI or Crestal

**Show:** Architecture diagram or component overview

### Live Demo (2-3 minutes)

#### Step 1: Create Smart Account (30 seconds)

"First, I'll create a MetaMask Smart Account on Monad testnet."

**Show:**
- Entering signer private key
- Clicking "Create Smart Account"
- Smart account address appearing

**Narrate:**
- "This creates an ERC-4337 smart account that supports delegations and gasless transactions"
- "The account is counterfactually deployed - it will be deployed on first use"

#### Step 2: Create Delegation (30 seconds)

"Next, I'll grant my AI agent permission to trade on my behalf using MetaMask delegations."

**Show:**
- Entering agent private key
- Clicking "Create Delegation"
- Success message

**Narrate:**
- "This delegation allows the agent to execute trades without requiring my signature each time"
- "It's secure because delegations can be revoked anytime"

#### Step 3: View Portfolio (30 seconds)

"Now let's look at my current portfolio."

**Show:**
- Portfolio balances table
- Current allocation percentages
- Total portfolio value

**Narrate:**
- "I have MON, USDC, USDT, and WETH"
- "My current allocation is imbalanced - let me set target percentages"

#### Step 4: Compute Strategy (45 seconds)

"I'll set my target allocation to 40% MON, 30% USDC, 20% USDT, and 10% WETH."

**Show:**
- Adjusting target percentage inputs
- Clicking "Compute Rebalancing Strategy"
- AI rationale appearing
- List of required trades

**Narrate:**
- "The AI analyzes my portfolio and computes the optimal trades"
- "It minimizes the number of swaps and gas costs"
- "Here's the AI's rationale and the exact trades needed"

#### Step 5: Execute Rebalancing (45 seconds)

"Let's execute the rebalancing."

**Show:**
- Clicking "Execute Rebalancing"
- Loading indicator
- Success message with transaction hash
- Opening Monad Explorer
- Transaction details on explorer

**Narrate:**
- "The agent batches all swaps into a single UserOperation"
- "This is sent via the smart account through a bundler"
- "Let's verify on Monad Explorer..."
- "Here you can see the transaction executed successfully on Monad testnet"

#### Bonus: Envio Indexing (optional, 30 seconds)

If time permits:

**Show:**
- Envio GraphQL playground
- Querying smart account data
- Historical trades and analytics

**Narrate:**
- "We also use Envio HyperIndex to track all events"
- "This provides analytics, historical data, and portfolio insights"

### Conclusion (30 seconds)

"Asset Nest demonstrates the power of combining MetaMask Smart Accounts, Monad's performance, AI intelligence, and decentralized infrastructure."

"This qualifies for multiple tracks:
- Best AI Agent
- Best On-Chain Automation
- Most Innovative Use of Delegations
- Best Use of Envio"

"Thank you for watching! The code is open source and ready to deploy."

**Show:** GitHub repo link or final slide with project name

## üé• Recording Tips

### Setup

1. **Clean browser window** - Close unnecessary tabs
