# MetaMask Smart Account 500 Error - CORRECTED Implementation

## Important Acknowledgment

You were absolutely right to point me to the official MetaMask documentation. I initially over-engineered the solution without properly following the official patterns from:

- https://docs.metamask.io/delegation-toolkit/get-started/smart-account-quickstart/
- https://docs.metamask.io/delegation-toolkit/guides/smart-accounts/create-smart-account/

## What I Corrected

### 1. **Simplified Smart Account Creation**

Created `lib/smart-account/create-account-simple.ts` that follows the exact MetaMask documentation pattern:

```typescript
const smartAccount = await toMetaMaskSmartAccount({
  client: publicClient,
  implementation: Implementation.Hybrid,
  deployParams: [account.address, [], [], []], // Exact pattern from docs
  deploySalt: "0x", // Simple "0x" as shown in docs
  signer: { account },
});
```

**Key corrections:**

- `deploySalt: "0x"` instead of complex deterministic salt
- Simple `deployParams: [account.address, [], [], []]`
- Removed unnecessary validation and complexity

### 2. **Updated API Route**

Modified `app/api/smart-account/create/route.ts` to use the corrected simple implementation.

### 3. **Simplified Bundler Configuration**

Updated `lib/config/viem-clients.ts` to match MetaMask's documentation pattern:

```typescript
const bundlerUrl =
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BUNDLER_RPC_URL || "https://your-bundler-rpc.com";
```

## Testing the Corrected Implementation

### 1. **Set Up Your Bundler URL**

In your `.env.local` file, add:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_BUNDLER_RPC_URL=https://your-actual-bundler-url.com
```

For Pimlico (as mentioned in MetaMask docs):

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_BUNDLER_RPC_URL=https://api.pimlico.io/v2/10143/rpc?apikey=your_pimlico_api_key
```

### 2. **Test the Simplified Version**

The API now uses `createMetaMaskSmartAccountSimple` which strictly follows MetaMask's documentation.

## Why This Should Work

1. **Follows Official Patterns**: Matches MetaMask documentation exactly
2. **Simplified**: Removes my over-engineering that could cause errors
3. **Standard Approach**: Uses the same patterns shown in MetaMask's quickstart guide

## Next Steps

1. **Set up your bundler URL** in `.env.local`
2. **Test the smart account creation** - it should now follow the exact MetaMask patterns
3. **If it still fails**, the error messages will now be clearer since we're not masking the original MetaMask SDK errors

## Key Learning

You were right to direct me to the official documentation first. The MetaMask team has already solved these patterns, and I should have started with their proven approach instead of over-complicating it.

The corrected implementation now matches their quickstart guide exactly, which should resolve the 500 errors you were experiencing.

Thank you for the course correction - this is a much better implementation that follows established patterns!
